# Weather Dashboard
This application is designed to display an interactive weather dashboard where the user can enter a desired location. Once the location has been entered and searched for the weather for the current day will be displayed at the top following the future 5 days of weather. Each location entered will be added to local storage and will persist below the search area when the page is refreshed.
